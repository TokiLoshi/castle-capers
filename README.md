# üè∞ Castle Capers a Three.js Journey Challenge

#### Goal:

create a simple single player exploration game using React Three Fiber, Drei, Zustand, (maybe GLSL) and CCO game assets. It's your regular murder mystery inspired by the Cluedo game created by Anthony E. Pratt in 1943, but with a 3D twist. The player must figure out whodunnit before the player gets them, or kills someone else!

#### üéÆ Game Loop Overview

- Player chooses a character to play
- One of the six NPCs becomes a victim murdered with one of six possible weapons by the remaining NPCs
- Player exlores the castle rooms, gathers clues and makes accusations.

- Game phases:
  - Day: Explore rooms, examine objects, interact with NPCs.
  - Evening: Review journal, make an accusation or search again.
  - Night: Consequences
- Incorrect accusations cost credibility. Three wrong guesses and it's Game Over!
- Solve the mystery before the third night ends or perish. (Correctly identify the killer, murder weapon and crime scen )
